As a user of the student enrolment system, I want to...
1	Offer subjects, so that students can enrol to study
	* Providing the subject code and subject name/description
	* I expect subject code to be unique.
	* I expect basic data validation to be carried out to ensure that only valid information is stored in the system.
		* Subject codes must contain 3 alphabetic characters followed by 3 digits between 0 and 9
		* Subject name must not be blank, and must not contain tab, line-feed, or form-feed symbols.
2	View a list of all subjects, so I can advise students about available offerings
3	Sort the subject list by name or subject code, so I can easily find a subject
4	Filter the list of subjects, so I can focus on one subject at a time
5	Edit an existing subject, so I can correct errors in the name or code
	* Editing must conform to the same validation rules as creation, including uniqueness.
6	Register students, so they can enrol in subjects to study
	* A unique student id number must be allocated when the student registers
	* In this prototype I am happy to record student name and id alone.
	* Names must be non-blank, and must not contain tab, line-feed, or form-feed symbols.
7	View a list of all students, so I can answer student enquiries about their enrolment and course progression.
8	Edit student name, so I can correct errors or record legal change of name.
9	Enrol a student in a subject, so they can commence study
	* The student will be enrolled in the current semester
10	View a student enrolment history, so I can evaluate their progress
	* History should be able to be sorted by semester, subject code, or subject name
11	Record or update the grade for a student in a subject in which they are enrolled, so students can progress toward their degree
12	Withdraw a student from a subject in which they are enrolled, so they can deal with changing circumstances
13	Advance the current semester to the next semester, so enrolments can commence in the new semester
	* This will mark all enrolments in the current semester as being complete.
	
14	Save a dataset containing all information present in the enrolment system, so I can carry out backups and resume work later.
15	Open a saved data set, so I can review historical data or resume work.
